# Header Images - Quick Start

## 🎨 Add Your Header Image NOW:

1. **Add ONE main image** to this folder: `header.jpg`
   - This will be your homepage background (blurred with dark overlay)
   - Any studio photo, painting in progress, workspace, etc.

2. **Image specs:**
   - Width: 1920px+ (or your photo's full resolution)
   - Height: 1080px+
   - Format: JPG
   - Don't worry about file size too much - Hugo will optimize

## 📸 What makes a good header image:

- Studio workspace
- Paintings in progress
- Close-ups of paints/brushes
- Natural light streaming in
- Wood textures
- Canvas details
- Your easel

The image will be blurred and darkened automatically to make text readable!

## 🔄 For rotating images (later):

You can add multiple images and configure rotation:
- `header-1.jpg`, `header-2.jpg`, etc.
- Update config to cycle through them

But for now, just add ONE image called `header.jpg` and you're done!
