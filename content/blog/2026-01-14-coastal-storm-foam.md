Today was all about foam and spray. Layer upon layer of white, each one a bit more opaque than the last. Used a combination of brush and palette knife to get that chaotic, natural look.

The trick is knowing when to stop. Too much and it looks like soap bubbles. Too little and there's no drama.

I think I'm close.
