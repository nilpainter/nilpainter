## The Concept

After years of avoiding seascapes, I'm finally tackling one. But not a peaceful one - I want the violence and beauty of a winter storm hitting the coast.

## Challenge

Capturing movement in a still image. The spray, the foam, the dark churning water. This is going to push my technique.

## Materials

- Canvas: 36x48" (going big)
- Medium: Oil with cold wax medium for texture
- Palette: Payne's grey, titanium white, raw umber, touches of phthalo blue
