I'm learning to paint. It's going about as well as you'd expect.

This blog is where I document the process—mostly the failures, occasionally something that doesn't look terrible. No lofty aspirations, just showing up and trying not to make the same mistake twice.

## What I Do

I paint, mostly in oils. Sometimes it resembles what I was aiming for. Other times I've created an expensive mess that I'll probably paint over next week. I'm slowly figuring out why my colours go muddy and why everything I paint looks a bit wonky.

## Why This Blog

Painting in a room by yourself gets a bit depressing after a while. This helps me pretend someone's paying attention, and maybe I'll look back in a year and see I've actually improved. If you're also muddling through, feel free to commiserate.
