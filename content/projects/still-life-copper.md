## Back to Basics

Sometimes you need to slow down and work small. This is my palette cleanser between big landscape pieces - a simple still life with my grandmother's copper pot.

## The Challenge

Copper is tricky. It's not just orange-red metal - it reflects everything around it. Blues from the window, greens from the wall, warm yellows from the light source.

## Setup

- Canvas: 12x16"
- Single light source from the left
- Dark background to make the copper glow
- A few oranges for color harmony
