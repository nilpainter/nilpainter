## The Vision

That magical moment when dawn light filters through bare winter branches. The way frost catches gold and blue at the same time. This is what I'm chasing.

## Technical Notes

- Canvas: 30x40"
- Medium: Oil on linen
- Palette: Cool blues, warm golds, deep umbers
- Technique: Glazing for the light effects

This one's going to take time. Multiple thin layers to build up that luminous quality.
